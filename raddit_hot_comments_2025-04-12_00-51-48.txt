Title: Trump Said Default the Debt and the Market Said Bet
Comments:
- Really liking this play by play
- 1st thing I would like to say is how much cocaine did you do last night?  Secondly I would like to say this is absolutely hilarious and you took the thoughts right out of my head ahhahaha!
- The real fun begins in 3 weeks. Since container ship traffic lags behind actual time by about 3 weeks all those shipments that left China since yesterday have 125 tariff. So in 3 weeks business owners will get a notice to pay 125 of their original order to clear the shipment through customs.   At that point it is pretty damn clear that business owners are facing increased cost that must be passed on to the consumers. I expect to see calls for impeachment over it. And it is all for naught.  The US makes up 3 of China's GDP. They could easily live without us. The notion they need us has been proven wrong since the last time Trump pulled the tariffs card. China simply found new trading partners. The GDP only measures hard goods. Services like payments for facebook ads and payments to American consultants. If it were measured by the GDP there would not be much trade deficit.
- You made me laugh. Its better than raging or crying. Im getting scared to even look at my portfolios.
- Thanks for the laugh

Title: Everyones Bearish So That Means Its Time to Buy, Right?
Comments:
- Ive been seeing this sort of comments and  every time I do prices go down even more
- This is only the first sign for those of us who understand this dynamic.   First people will acknowledge islets the bear market after pretending is wasnt.   Then these people try to buy the bottom.   The real time to ramp ur buys up is when no one is talking about crypto. Be patient. This will take months.    In 2022 when bitcoin hit 30k all my friends didnt want to talk about crypto anymore. So I started buying. Got an average of about 30k after 2 years. Sold in mid 2024 while everyone was saying the bull market hasnt even started yet   Be patient. Have income. DCA. Ive already started but only as a way to get started. Not planning on scaling my position in for another 1-2 years   Both stocks and crypto
- Buying the dip is not the same as buying the downtrend
- Two days ago it was time to buy. Yesterday was time to sell. Sorry for your losses, I'm with you fam
- It will go even lower

Title: Why is ETH doing so bad
Comments:
- Turns out every crypto is useless, we're still early
- Your going to get a lot of typical reddit sarcasm for this question, But i'm going to try my best. First No one knows besides maybe a few insiders or institutions. So A: It's being manipulated so they shake out weak hands. B. It's not cool or new or fun anymore, the profit isnt there for people. C. They want you to question it, 1,395 ETH, will probably end up being a dream 3 years down the road. D. BTC Dominance, Ben Cowen the man child talks about this alot. Study, and do research. I'm 5050 Hbar vs ETH right now, i'm in at good prices, and i feel lucky to do so.    And of course, do your own research! :D
- Many people said that every service will have their own token, that idea now is dead and is just Ethereum.   Another idea is that Ethereum value will always be bigger than the TVL, if TVL is 1B then Ethereum market cap needs to be at least 1B, that idea will be proven wrong too.   Ethereum is valuable and will continue to survive but value will be created on upper layers, just like any other economy.
- Why is everything on a downtrend? I dont hold eth, but everything is on a downtrend.  Btc, alts, my life, my mind.
- You need to separate the price and the ecosystem. The ecosystem is growing be it number of stakers, total stablecoin market cap reached ATH, more and more RWA projects, Blackrock's buidl fund surpassed 1bn, Deutsche bank is gonna launch a L2 etc. For price, crypto trading unlike stocks are not subject to regulation, most of the exchangesmarket makers have their trading floor in DubaiSingapore.

Title: New tariffs for China 145
Comments:
- China retaliate to new tariffs by selling U.S. Treasuries, which is a strategy they have used in the past. As one of the largest holders of U.S. debt, China selling a significant amount of Treasuries could put pressure on U.S. interest rates, making borrowing more expensive. It could also weaken the dollar, which might benefit China's exports but could lead to global economic instability and higher inflation. This would be a form of economic leverage in response to the tariffs. The war is here.
- I will simply wait for orange man to declare good news, like the 90 day delay of tariffs, sell everything, then wait for him to say some weird shit and buy the dump.   Improvise, adapt, overcome.
- 1,000,000,00  tariffs coming soon!
- With these tariffs, markets are gonna get pretty volatile. Crypto might see some action as a hedge, but it's hard to predict exactly how it'll move.
- Market is so shitt that I hardly check on it since weeks.Bcz it won't going anywhere anytime soon. Mfr Trump manipulating it pumping and dumping.

Title: Cardano Founder Sees Bitcoin Hitting 250K In 2025: Heres Why
Comments:
- So fat chuck is done yachting around and is back making predictions? Cool.
- ...on the condition that likes of Apple, Microsoft or Amazon suddenly invest in bitcoins.
- Are Trump, Stephen Miller, JD Vance (not going to list all twenty odd people) going to croak before the end of 2025, because no shot Bitcoin gets above half of that with ongoing trade wars between the two biggest world economies and the potential expansive of global military conflicts with US involvement.
- Charles be as well taking another trip on his camel, crypto bros are deluded
- If micro strategy has to sell any of theirs there no chance in hell Apple or Microsoft is going to convince their board members to buy

Title: What should I hodl?
Comments:
- Everything has potential because the bull is still to come. As long as you're prepared to wait at least 6 years, go for it.
- Wife.
- Cash is king just now, be patient, better prices to come
- XRP, XLM, or HBAR would be my choices. Let it simmer into 2026 or keep it forever. Theyre not going to zero. Itll be like buying Apple computer at a dollar if you hold long term. JMO
- Chainlink could flip around 


Post 14:
Title: Bitcoin currently attempting to transition to a risk off asset
Comments:
- I agree, I actually trust BTC in this environment MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I'm glad I have a high allocation to btc
- Bitcoins advantage in global trade over gold is instant, barrier free settlement.  China and Russia are already starting to recognize this, the world will follow
- I don't think this will happen the way history has unfolded so far. BTC remains very high risk very volatile.

Title: Crypto upi
Comments:
- Just put it in your wallet and swap for a stable coin then keep it.
- Which giveaway
- It's clearly a scam, an indian telling you to buy solana for a cheaper price, I can smell the scam from Jupiter


Post 16:
Title: Thoughts on Polkadot?
Comments:
- I once thought it was great, but the user friendliness really hurts it, staking method pushes the value down, and interoperability lag behind competitors. It had a lot of hype around the parachain auctions and some of those ended up being outright scams.
- Trash coin, dots echo system and parachains have been a complete failure
- Dots value proposition is completely undermined by chainlinks CCIP.   Why would builders trap themselves within the DOT ecosystem, when with CCIP they can access every Blockchain ecosystem possible?
- You wont like my answer but I wont consider any Alt coins now.  All are still extremely overvalued.  Most of these carry more value that most of the ETFs that trade on the stock market, and those are filled with companies that have billions in revenue
- Have you seen its all time chart?

Title: What the hell happened to theta
Comments:
- If you watch Benjamin Cowens videos on YouTube you will understand bitcoin dominance in relation to QE and QT. Until we move back to QE you will continue to see btc dominance rise as it is the less risky option. Altcoin season will likely return once liquidity increases.
- You picked a bad month not to look at your portfolio. With all the uncertainty this trade war created, everything is tanking. If Trump would take a break from shorting the markets, maybe things can recover.
- Everything is down from previous highs as crypto has been in a bear market for 6 months now making lower lows


Post 21:
Title: Why do marketplaces generally limit cash withdraw?
Comments:
- They dont want to give you all your money back at 1 time. They. Would rather keep it
- If you have 100k on a exchange youd be lucky to get it all out in one go theyd come up with some kind of bs to slow the transaction down over days or so
- It's because they don't have the money. They are most likely over-leveraged, like all banks are, and there's legal implications to it too.   According to US standards, 10kday is the Universal limit (per transaction). After that, you are breaking Federal laws. Subject to limitations, restrictions, and exceptions.   They will also operate like a casino and hope you keep spending your winnings with them, restricting withdrawal, mainly why I don't use exchanges.
- Better do P2P that withdraw it
- Laundering, ach fraud, consumer protections in general, etc. theres a lot going on in banking that isnt full proof most consumers dont know exist. These exchanges take on risk just by allowing you to ach funds and trade right away

Title: The Bull Run Experience
Comments:
- 2021 was epic for crypto, especially  coins. The world was on lockdown, nobody could spend their money and governments were handing out cash, the money printer was switched on.  Money flowed in to crypto big time, everyone was talking about it and everyone thought they were going to get rich, every coin was pumping hard and the euphoria was flowing, the only mistake made by many, they either got in too late or got greed and never took profits, 95 got crushed in the end, market tanked and alt coins were destroyed leaving their holders licking their wounds. I doubt it will ever be repeated.
- 2021 will never be repeated again. That was a one-off epic event for Alts.
- That Wall Street cheat sheet about the cycles? That's real in terms of psychology, that's exactly what it feels like. So anon, how do you feel rn?
- End of 2021 was glorious! I would look at app every 5 minutes with joy and confidence. There were definitely some down days but those just kept things fun.
- Does "into crypto" mean you are gambling a substantial amount of assets in this space? Crypto is closer to gambling or speculation (or a state lottery) than it is to investment.   Like the lottery or most schemes, you will hear the "winners" announced, but the millions of losers rarely come forward and calculate how much they've spent over the years.   I've been part of some very exciting "runs" in stocks....and a bit in Bitcoin. No doubt watching 10K turn into 80K had me wondering why I was going to work and making that much in a year (back then). But none of it was really real. When I blend it with everything I owned, etc. it didn't speed up my financial security, retirement etc.  That only comes from work and constant savings into solid investments (usually the stock market - mutual funds).

Title: Is tokenized gold the real digital gold instead of BTC?
Comments:
- Gold pegged coins are very centralized compared to bitcoin though.  Eventually, people are going to want to sell their real gold and it might be easier to trade it for bitcoin than cash.  Its just a matter of time before all the gold dealers get with the program and learn they can trade back-and-forth with bitcoin  Bitcoin priced in Troy ounces gold  https:www.tradingview.comsymbolsBTCXAUT  Troy ounces gold priced in bitcoin  https:www.tradingview.comsymbolsXAUTBTC  Bitcoin  kilogram of Gold  https:www.tradingview.comchart?symbolTVC3ABTCXAUK  Kilogram of gold   Bitcoin  https:www.tradingview.comchart?symbolTVC3AXAUBTCK  1 million worth of gold is about 10 kg or 22 LBS  1 million worth of bitcoin has no weight at all.
- There are exchanges you can buy gold and silver as digital and you can request the actual metals sent to you
- If you're so bullish long-term after a black swan event, what are your concerns?   If you enter right now an it even dips below you can sell an have a minimal loss at minimal risk, with still room for upside. I'm in no means a BTC maxi btw.

Title: I use a Tangem wallet
Comments:
- Depend your country. Every transaction of swapping is taxable. Just remember its very hard to time the market.   Here an example, you can split your portfolio to 50 backup funds (Usdt, this fund for backup market go down you buy more or life emergency), 25 live trading funds (fund jumping in and out, goal accumulated free tokens add to your HODL account) and 25 fixed Hodl tokens long term. Only an example as everyone different.   Everyone has different end goal. Ask yourself what you want achieve and write a plan.
- how will you swap? don't use changelly
- Swapping to stablecoins like USDC or Tether can help lock in gains, but consider the fees. USDC is often seen as more transparent, but both are solid options.

- So buy Caterpillar instead?
- okAI
- It should read China hit the US BACK with an 84 tarif. The world is only REacting to Orange Man
- There has been so much fiat printed that so many things correlate now, especially with HFT firms creating price actions when things move.   I've been thinking there is less value than normal in short term analysis these days

Comments:
- Basically he figured out how to accomplish mutually assured destruction without having to dust off 70 year old nukes.
- Lovely. It should be 400.
- Right on President Trump we finally elected a president who truly loves this great country and has enough guts and nuts to stand up and fight for countryman , America has been getting fucked over Royalty but all the major trading countries for way to long. And he's has our American working man business man all Americans greatest interest front and center he has done more good for this country in 6 months then the lying crooks sell out Democrat s have accomplished sense J FK Trump is not only saving this great country he making changes that will benefit my Great grandchild and future generations ,the average joe has no clue the damage done and that our future is at high risk of freedom and quality of living was being taken and giving away by the stupid and lying stealing Democrats we we head for a one class country and at risk of losing our freedom.Joe Biden should be in prison for treason he sold us out his people sold us out and the thought of Kamala horse shit Harris being in charge of my countries future make me through up and shit my drowers. Trump was put in charge appointed by the loving power of God no question, And it goes to show us that God still loves and care for this great country built on Christian principles and qualities like standards love and freedom and equality I could say so much more about how fortunate America is to have a man of character integrity that truly loves and cares about this great country and it people ,and he got the brains the courage and guts and one of the greatest business men of our times.

Title: Introducing EWT ACMI  A Smarter Way to Track Crypto Market Health
Comments:
- Congrats for the hard work.   If I may suggest some UIfunctionality improvements:  Remove the chart data markers in mobile devices. Increase the relative height of the chart. Add a date range filter.  This is probably impossible, but it would be amazing if you could add weight inputs to the UI so the user uses his own component distribution for the ACMI formula (MC, Volume, IV). This is because depending on the asset, it makes sense to give more weight to volume instead of market cap for instance. Not sure if the calculation happens on the fly or you are persisting it though.

Title: Why would anybody still want to stay in this market?
Comments:
- Adrenaline, dopamine, addiction, depression.
- People that are smiling are those not gambling  Buy BTC, kick back and relax for a few years    The days of being able to trade any other crypto for reliable gains are long gone because they are all centralised scams and Hawk Tuah tokens   If a chick slobbering on a dick is a good enough reason for the creation of a token, it tells you all you need to know about the wider crypto market
- Aye yeah wait until theres no profit left, good plan
- Scared money dont make money. Embrace your inner degenerate.
- The bull run hasnt even started yet at all! I take it most people on the subs have been in crypto for less than 3ish  years or less.

Title: Taxes Canada: Do I really need to pay for crypto tax software if I ended up losing everything?
Comments:
- Canadian here too , in the same boat , profited a couple bucks( literally)I don't plan on reporting it , not worth the effort, especially since kraken only reports transactions over 10k , I'll deal with the CRA once it's worth while but for now just holding what I got. The CRA will definitely let us know if we owe ;)
- If you gave not made a sale you have no gains or loses yet
- If you had a net positive gain then yes.   Generally I'm waiting on, the possibility of my 2020 bear market losses to become realized. But they still haven't and they are extreme. This market uncertainty fucking sucks. I'm waiting to balance out.   Personally, I'm not concerned even mentioning it all, because to me, it's not even relevant, but I do have all my records in case of an audit.   If you really want to, then yes. It all depends on how diligent you want to be and have eyes on you, tracking your crypto investments 247?   If you start reporting capital losses, they are more likely to flag you. But by all means do it. It's the law.
- Even if you lost everything, you still gotta file your gains. There are cheap or free tools for it. If you skip it, you might get hit with fines, so it's better to just do it
- Use koinly, its super easy. If your down it will give you a tax break, but either way, its better to avoid a situation where the cra is against you (more so then they already are)

- Translation   You have no clue
- Dont be as dumb as op. I made these mistakes by trying to time the market last 2 cycles. Just dca. No one can predict shit. Have some cash on the side in case it goes down.

Title: What crypto to buy right now long term
Comments:
- Right now you shouldnt go all in on anything, the market might collapse. Buy 20 of your investment now, and 10 more each month as the prices drop. The aim would be to drive your average costs down by at least 30-50 over the next 8 months.  Btc should be 70-80 of your portfolio. SOL, eth, xrp, hbar, sui, and link good options for the other 20  I also like NOS, Grass, and Jasmy but they are less well known. NOS and GRASS have 30 staking options which makes weathering a bear market easier cause you can still increase your bag if in the red and sell the interest during the next 2028 bull run.  If you dive into meme coins stick to the big names like Bonk and avoid the pump and dump trash
- Monero. Relatively stable, the OG private crypto, and the crazier the world gets the better use case it has.
- Avalanche
- Link, BTC and ETH
- XRP

Comments:
- You got 89 days to sell your bag
- I would say its temporary. Nothing jumps this much without crashing down a bit as people who bought the bottom take profits.
- Of course it is. There's no such thing as constant in the crypto world.
- Everything in life is temporary, the only question is your timeline.
- No one knows how to analyze anything anymoreits all based on tweets.get yourself a tweet notification app and just sit there and wait for the pings

- Were so late were early again.
- No we are actually all fucking morons. Especially the ones who voted for this.
