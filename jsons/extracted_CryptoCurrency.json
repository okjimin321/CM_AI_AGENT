        "Body": "Hey everyone. One of my good friends recently started crypto trading after being introduced by this woman claiming to be from Singapore, who works with a team of traders and analysts. I also trade myself, but primarily on the Forex market. Now there's a lot that I don't know specifically about the crypto side of trading, but there were quite a few red flags I noticed from what he was telling me. Since starting, he's apparently increased his initial investment more than 10-fold from following this woman's strategy. I know there's a chance of seeing those kind of returns given the volatility in crypto, if you're lucky, but he's only been doing this for less than 3 months. I don't see how a legitimate, well-thought out strategy with proper risk management would generate these kind of returns. I can understand if it's someone's first time and they're doing this on their own (basically gambling or yolo trading), but this is someone else's 'strategy' he's following, who's supposed to be a professional. A disciplined trader who knows what they're doing wouldn't be encouraging the kinda leverage you would need to generate a 10-fold return, let alone encouraging him to deposit the amount of money that he did. There's also a lot of jargon I've never heard before, but after some explanation from my friend, it still doesn't really make sense to me. I don't know if maybe he's explaining it wrong, but it just doesn't add up. And it's certainly not terminology that I've heard in trading before. For example, he's supposed to be learning 'mining' this coming week, which I thought was referring to bitcoin mining. But again either he didn't explain it well or this 'guru' is feeding him a load of rubbish, because his description of it sounded more vaguely like a hedge fund. I asked him if he's been able to make any withdrawals. He hasn't made any yet but says he's in the process of doing so. I fear that whoever these people are are simply taking money from people like him with no intentions of giving any of it back. But since I know relatively very little about crypto, I didn't immediately voice my concerns, although now I really wish I did. There's probably some parts I missed, but I'm going based off of what I remember from our phonecall yesterday. I want to give my friend the best advice going forward, but I want to relay that advice from someone who knows what they're talking about. Any thoughts?",

        "Body": "Tokenization, as championed by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, represents a transformative shift in financial markets. By converting assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate into blockchain-based digital tokens, tokenization aims to democratize investing and enhance accessibility. Fink envisions a future where ownership and transactions occur seamlessly on blockchain platforms, enabling 24-hour trading and reducing settlement times from days to seconds. This innovation could open markets to a broader range of investors, reduce costs, and improve liquidity. However, regulatory hurdles and cybersecurity challenges remain significant obstacles to widespread adoption. In real estate, tokenization allows fractional ownership of properties, making investments more accessible and liquid. Investors can trade tokens representing property shares globally with lower entry barriers and transaction costs. This approach enhances transparency through blockchain technology while enabling efficient cross-border investments. Despite its potential, tokenization faces regulatory uncertainties and cybersecurity challenges that must be addressed for broader implementation across industries.",

Same with the FETH ETF and ethereum itself. I imagine if one were in love with bitcoin you could maybe make a little more by avoiding fees buying coin yourself rather than going through an ETF.  Are all cryptocurrency ETFs associated with particular coins? I'm asking because I know coins come and go, and I have no attachment with any ones in particular. If there were an ETF that managed buying and selling and coins as they wax and wain, I'd consider paying some management fees to not try and keep up with that myself.

That said there are ones which dont actually hold the underlying asset and i wouldnt touch with a barge pole. Eg an xrp one came out this week at 2x leverage but with no xrp purchases.   I have heard of some providers wanting to offer package deals such as top 10 coins with the same splits as market cap or more managed but i dont believe any have passed in usa yet.   Most round here would way rather own the asset itself and fees on exchanges likely to be less in mid to long term as no holding fees usually but etfs are useful for those not wanting to own the storage and tech risks and challenges.",

        "Body": "On April 10, 2025, President Donald Trump signed a resolution officially killing the controversial IRS 'DeFi Broker Rule,' a regulatory measure that would have fundamentally reshaped the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape in the United States. Originally introduced during the final days of the Biden administration, the rule sought to expand the definition of a broker to include decentralized finance platformsentities that by design operate without intermediaries or centralized control. Had the rule gone into effect, it would have forced DeFi protocolsmany of which are governed by code, not companiesto comply with traditional tax reporting standards, including collecting and submitting user data to the IRS and prepare and submit 1099-DAs reporting over user proceeds. This mandate presented an existential threat to DeFi, which relies on anonymity, self-custody, and peer-to-peer transactions. Many platforms would have been unable to comply due to the sheer absence of KYC (Know Your Customer) infrastructure, and developers could have faced legal risk simply for creating or maintaining open-source code. The implications for the U.S. crypto community would have been severe: developers might have fled to jurisdictions with more favorable regulatory climates, capital would have followed, and innovation in blockchain-based financial tools could have been stifled for years. In effect, the rule would have driven DeFi out of the U.S.handing the future of financial decentralization to other nations. DeFi would be dead, and U.S. crypto investors would effectively be limited to trading on centralized exchanges. The repeal signals a major win for the crypto industry and a recognition that overly aggressive regulation risks killing the very innovation it claims to protect. With this rule overturned, U.S.-based builders, investors, and users can continue to participate in the growing DeFi ecosystem without fear of regulatory overreach. Its a critical step in ensuring that America remains a competitive and welcoming hub for Web3 innovation. If the IRS wants to make up silly rules, Congress will need to rewrite new measures that actually synergize with a pro-crypto United States, or otherwise risk another embarrassing repeal. More discussion to come on how this impacts your tax preparation and strategy in navigating this evolving ecosystem.",

Much has changed over the last 7 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokenslike I do for my. Experiments(https:toptencryptoindexfund.comannouncing-top-10-2025)). This years friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index(COIN50).COIN50tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

Combining the 2018 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios. So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments? 2018 Top Ten Experiment(https:toptencryptoindexfund.comtracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-. month-85): up 25 (total value 1,249) 2019 Top Ten Experiment(https:toptencryptoindexfund.comtracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-. month-74): up 542 (total value 6,420) 2020 Top Ten Experiment(https:toptencryptoindexfund.comtracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-. month-63): up 766 (total value 8,655) (best performing portfolio) 2021 Top Ten Experiment(https:toptencryptoindexfund.comtracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-. month-45): up 280 (total value 3,798) 2022 Top Ten Experiment(https:toptencryptoindexfund.comtracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-. month-34): down -25 (total value 753) (worst performing portfolio) 2023 Top Ten Experiment(https:toptencryptoindexfund.comtracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-. month-23): up 142 (total value 2,422) 2024 Top Ten Experiment(https:toptencryptoindexfund.comtracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-. month-12): up 38 (total value 1,384) 2025 Top Ten Experiment(https:toptencryptoindexfund.comtracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-. month-3): down -22 (total value 776) Taking the eight portfolios together: After a 8,000 total investment in the 2018 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,the combined portfolios are worth26,959 https:preview.redd.itplwr7wx048ue1.png?width603formatpngautowebps1295b3ea551ce752e3584c589b6545cea4777948 Thats up 218on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios wasNovember 2021s all time. high(https:toptencryptoindexfund.comtracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-. month-11)of533. Heres the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020: https:preview.redd.iths18tyj348ue1.png?width961formatpngautowebps30339161168bfcf19a1f0023e697377e00b08c97 In summary:Thats a 218 gain by investing 1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years. Comparison to SP 500 Im also tracking the SP 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. The SP 500 is down -4 so far in 2025, so the initial 1k investment into crypto on New Years Day would be worth 958 had it been redirected to the SP. Taking the same invest-1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the SP 500 that Ive been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following: 1000 investment in SP 500 on January 1st, 2018 2,107 today 1000 investment in SP 500 on January 1st, 2019 2,248 today 1000 investment in SP 500 on January 1st, 2020 1,744 today 1000 investment in SP 500 on January 1st, 2021 1,500 today 1000 investment in SP 500 on January 1st, 2022 1,182 today 1000 investment in SP 500 on January 1st, 2023 1,467 today 1000 investment in SP 500 on January 1st, 2024 1,181 today 1000 investment in SP 500 on January 1st, 2025 958 today Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the SP: After eight 1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an SP 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth 12,387. That is up55since January 2018(https:toptencryptoindexfund.comtracking-2018-top-ten-month-one)compared to a218gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

In a new interview on the Unchained podcast, Hayes says Ethereum has a higher risk-reward ratio compared to Solana going forward.  If you have a fresh unit of fiat of capital, what do you do with it? Do you buy Solana or do you buy ETH right now given all the things that are happening? And so I would say ETH from a risk-reward perspective is better  whenever you have a turn in the cycle, you want to own the most hated thing because thats going to perform the best. And you dont want to own the most loved thing from the previous cycle because thats going to perform the worst.  Thats not to say that Solana is not going to go up a lot.  But relative to something else, is it going to perform as well? And so I think ETH has sort of the market fundamentals to do very well in this next leg up because people hate it so much.  Hayes says that one of the factors limiting Solanas upside potential is the fact that the narrative that powered Solanas rally to a new all-time high in January is unlikely to reach similar heights of popularity.  Solana did very well on sort of the memecoin supercycle, or whatever you want to call it, over the last 18-24 months.  But I think that, yes, there will be some meme coins that do well  but are we going to go back to where we were 12 months ago where everybody and their mother was just like slinging memecoins trying to find the 1 million market cap that goes to 100 million market cap and just handing hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to PumpFun?  I dont think were going back there and so I think all that activity that was on Solana based on memecoin trading wont be there. And so the narrative of, oh, memecoin trading is amazing, the anti-Venture Capital way to participate in crypto is on Solana, therefore I need to own Solana as the layer-1 that hosted all that activity. I think that narrative goes away...",

It feels like the market has totally evolved with new exchanges, better security, and even new regulations that werent around a few years back. I used to stick to one major platform (Binance), but Ive noticed fees creeping up, and the interface is starting to feel cluttered with all the extra features. Meanwhile, I keep hearing about smaller or newer exchanges claiming to be the best crypto exchange, offering low trading fees, better staking options, or even features like advanced limit orders and instant transfers. Im specifically looking for an exchange that: Has solid customer support (live chat, email, or at least decent ticket response times) Charges lower fees for frequent traders Allows easy fiat onoff ramps (so depositing and withdrawing actual money doesnt become a nightmare) Is reputable enough that I dont have to worry about hacks or shady behavior Has anyone found a reliable go-to platform that checks these boxes in 2025? Im curious if the new entrants really live up to the hype or if its all marketing. Also, any hidden catches (like sneaky withdrawal fees or random inactivity charges) youve come across? Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences! Im hoping to settle on one main exchange soon, rather than juggling accounts all over the place.",

        "Body": "Hey everyone! So, I'm just starting to get the hang of Binance, and I'm trying to figure out the best way to get my local currency turned into USDT (Tether) so I can start trading. Right now, the way I'm doing it feels a little roundabout, and maybe a bit expensive in terms of fees. Basically, what I've been doing is converting my local currency (let's say it's Rupees, Euros, or whatever your country uses!) into US dollars first. Then, with those US dollars, I buy Binance Coin (BNB), which is Binance's own cryptocurrency. Finally, I take that BNB and convert it into USDT. It feels a bit like taking the long way around, right? The problem I'm running into is that each of those conversions costs a little bit in fees. Those fees might seem small on their own, but they definitely add up, and over time, they can eat into your profits (or even increase your losses!). I've noticed I've lost a noticeable amount due to these fees, which isn't ideal when you're just starting out. I've been trying to research other ways to do this, and I've seen a couple of alternatives mentioned, like using Litecoin (LTC) or Solana (SOL). But honestly, the whole process still feels a little confusing, and I'm not really sure which way is the best way, or even if those alternatives are actually cheaper in the long run, especially when you factor in transfer times which could lead to price fluctuations. So, I was hoping that some of you more experienced crypto folks could give me some suggestions. I'm really open to any advice you have!",

        "Title": "I officially submitted Full Binance violations and case files to the Dubai crypto regulator(VARA)",
        "Creation-Time": "2025-04-10 08:25:56",
        "Body": "Binance stalled, they deflected, they rotated agents, they offered silence. I built a full 13-page case. VARA officially requested the material so I sent them everything. This is not just a support complaint this is an official regulatory case. Evidence submitted includes chats, screenshots, timelines, agent logs, and financial breakdowns. Binance failed to provide any resolution after multiple deadlines. Thank you for your previous response. As requested, I have attached a detailed PDF file containing all of the documents, screenshots, timelines, and correspondence related to my complaint against Binance. I kindly ask you to review this material thoroughly. This is not merely a personal grievance it is a reflection of deeper systemic failures in Binances platform and their customer support structure. The issue I raise is not about trading losses or market volatility. It is about transparency, accountability, and the integrity of Binances internal systems. My account was force-liquidated under conditions that do not align with the actual margin levels or market volatility. I had sufficient margin at the time, and yet, the position was liquidated and I was charged over 100 in fees exceeding the positions own size. I documented this anomaly extensively, including Binances repeated delays, sudden silence, and pattern of shifting between customer agents without progressing the case. I provided Binance with a 7-day legal deadline to respond before escalating to regulatory bodies. This deadline was ignored. Only after I informed Binance that I had formally submitted the case to VARA did their tone suddenly change. I was transferred to a so-called Escalation Team, which showed signs of internal panic excessive politeness, sudden rechecks, and scripted empathy. However, this shift lasted briefly. Once they confirmed that I am not a UAE resident, their responses reverted to silence and copy-pasted apologies. They stopped replying again. It is also important to note that I am not alone. Over 20 users have reached out with similar liquidation cases that lack justification. These cases are strikingly similar instant liquidation, lack of volatility, no explanation, and eventual silence. It is increasingly clear that this may not be an isolated incident but a system-level failure or bug within Binances liquidation engine. What makes this situation particularly difficult is the power imbalance between the user and the platform. Binance controls the interface, the logs, and the communication flow. Meanwhile, users are left with no recourse other than to accept silence vouchers or ambiguous promises of further review. This is not just about compensation its about trust in the financial infrastructure. I'm binance user from 2018 and I don't deserve such behavior. A platform that silences users instead of investigating real issues is not just being negligent, it may be in breach of basic consumer protection standards. I ask you to look beyond my specific liquidation and examine the pattern this case reveals. The issue here is not simply about margin calculations or platform errors its about how a financial giant like Binance handles complaints, how it manipulates silence, and how it hides behind scripted empathy and rotational support to exhaust users into giving up. In my experience, and in conversations with others whove gone through similar events, it has become evident that Binances internal systems are either flawed or strategically designed to suppress resolution. Their agents repeat prewritten lines, offer delay tactics masked as internal reviews, and strategically introduce confusion by constantly transferring chats between agents each of whom claims to just now begin reviewing the case. At times, I was made to repeat the same information to six or seven different people in a single day. And after all that, I would be told: Please wait, our relevant team is still reviewing. But what triggered the most shocking response was not technical evidence, not the loss itself it was simply the mention of VARA. The moment I stated that I had submitted the case to your institution, I was immediately moved to a so-called Escalation Team. The tone changed. The politeness increased. They suddenly took my case seriously. But that, too, lasted only until they realized I was not a UAE resident. Once they confirmed this, the support went silent again. If this is how Binance responds based on jurisdiction rather than justice then its not only a platform issue, its a regulatory concern. I want to emphasize this again: over 20 users have reached out with nearly identical stories. I have collected fragments, screenshots, chat logs, and liquidation reports from many of them. And although my case may be one voice, it is part of a larger echo one that is growing louder as Binance refuses to offer a transparent explanation. In many cases, users were liquidated despite having strong margin, with positions closing during periods of no unusual volatility. The only common thread? Silence followed by a generic apology and in rare cases, a small voucher. This isnt about compensation anymore. This is about preventing future harm, demanding transparency from a platform that processes billions in user funds, and asking a regulator with reach and credibility such as VARA to examine whether this system is operating in the shadows. I am not a UAE resident, but I submitted my case through Dubais DED portal (CMP-25-471649). I trust that jurisdiction alone will not be the basis for inaction not when the issue at hand may reflect a deeper technical or ethical failure. In addition to the broader concerns I have already expressed, I believe there are several critical case elements that must be officially acknowledged: Language used by support agents including indirect gambler profiling during an active investigation. Contradictory and unclear responses between departments, which damaged trust and transparency. Financial pressure caused by unresolved losses and outstanding loans resulting from this incident. Promised answers particularly following the March 29 escalation were never provided. The case appeared to be closed, then reopened, without clear explanation. Even after reopening, the new promised updates (due Tuesday) never arrived. No one told me why. And finally the core incident remains unresolved: Despite my account being marked as bankrupt, over 30 of my total balance was still taken as post-liquidation fees. To this day, no explanation has been provided as to how a bankrupt account could be subject to such deductions, rather than that balance being used to reduce losses or protect open positions. I hope this submission brings more clarity, and I place my full trust in VARA to help shed light on what truly happened. The attached documents provide my evidence. If further clarity is needed, I will gladly assist in any way. There is one more detail that has disturbed me throughout this experience and I believe it warrants closer attention. At multiple stages during this case, I was told that I had a gamblers status on the platform. This label was never explained not how its assigned, not why it matters, not how it affects the way my account is handled. But the tone of the platform changed after this status appeared. I noticed increased delays, and interactions became even more evasive. If Binance has internal profiling systems that categorize users based on trading behavior and if such labels affect customer support treatment, risk models, or liquidation protocols then this is a much larger issue than a single case. Even more troubling is the growing suspicion that some of these liquidation events may not be accidental. The silence, the refusal to show clear logs, the overly delayed support structure it begins to resemble a mechanism designed not just to deflect, but to control the narrative and quietly close user cases. I cannot definitively prove that my case was targeted or pre-engineered but the pattern of behavior, the sudden internal shifts, and the suppression of transparency suggest that something deeper may be at play. If Binance has constructed a system where individual accounts are monitored and selectively pushed into failure under the guise of risk control that would constitute a massive ethical and possibly legal breach. Even if that is not the case, the mere possibility that profiles like mine are subject to automated flags, and that these flags affect fairness in how liquidations occur, should be investigated. The use of vague internal labels like gambler, combined with a pattern of unjustified liquidations and copy-paste replies, does not reflect the behavior of a transparent financial institution. It reflects a platform that creates an illusion of fairness while certain users are quietly sidelined. Binance cant justify irreversible outcomes using designations made retroactively. This is not risk I accepted. This is post-factum classification a system where users are flagged, blamed, and penalized without context, transparency, or process. If Binance truly believed I was high risk, they should have intervened before my account was liquidated not after. Placing me into the Responsible Trading Program post-liquidation is not risk management its retroactive blame-shifting. Its clear this flag serves one function: to protect Binance from liability, not to protect the user. I dont believe I ever deserved to be placed in the Responsible Trading Program. I use a well-defined strategy with a clear risk management framework. Binance made this classification without ever verifying my trading logic or asking for context which makes it a subjective designation that primarily serves their own internal risk optics, not a fair evaluation of user behavior. If Binance had made any effort to understand my system, they would know I dont use stop losses because I hedge manually, and my bots follow a disciplined, non-random execution logic. I use cross margin exclusively, and my choice of higher leverage is deliberate its meant to reduce unnecessary margin lockup, not to increase risk. Cross margin ensures the system can automatically allocate protection where its actually needed. So what may look like a 20x position is in reality balanced across available assets and is part of a controlled portfolio approach, not gambling. If they evaluated context, they would know this. I respectfully ask VARA to: Accept the attached full case file and formally acknowledge the issues Ive raised. Investigate the technical inconsistency that led to my liquidation and the suspiciously high fees. Clarify Binances obligations under Dubais regulatory framework in terms of dispute resolution, response times, and internal escalation procedures. Open dialogue with Binance to request a transparent explanation of their liquidation mechanisms and any known internal issues that could lead to unjust liquidations. I am placing my trust in your institution as a regulator that upholds fairness, especially when users are systematically ignored. I understand that I may not be a UAE resident, but I submitted the case through Dubais Department of Economy and Tourism (DED Case CMP-25-471649), which has confirmed acceptance. At this point, I must ask clearly: Will any action be taken? I was led to believe that action would follow that my efforts to document everything and report properly would not go ignored. I hope VARA is not only receiving these cases but standing by those of us who have no other shield left. Because if even the regulators go silent then justice simply doesnt exist for users like me. I sincerely hope VARA stands with users when platforms fail them because for some of us, this is the last line. I look forward to your continued guidance and action. Please let me know if any further documents or clarifications are needed. Best regards, Tornike Legal Grounds and Clauses Violated - Clause 6.1: Right to transparent calculation before deduction. - Clause 6.3: Manifest error clause system behavior must be logically sound. - Clause 30.1: Binance waives liability only in absence of gross negligence or material breach. Both are evident in this case. If I had accepted the 13 hush voucher, none of this would be known. But I didnt. And now, it will be. I encourage you to share this is the only way we hold centralized platforms accountable.",

Ive seen a lot about this token called shoppymint, all the research that Ive done makes me worry that its a total scam. Ive gone to the accounts of all the comments on their videos on TikTok in YouTube and its clearly bots. To me this feels like an obvious red flag but I was curious if anyone has heard of it? I wasnt really able to find any reputable information on them anywhere besides their own socials. Any advice would be sincerely appreciated. Thank you.",

Deepseek.  told me one more thing but that's because I asked it a different question.  Asked.  it that how Chinese crypto affect VET coin and it told since china has strictly.  banned crypto so VET has very low chances of goingup however there are rumors.  that china might remove the bans or be less strict or something and we could.  potentially see a rise then.  What are your thoughts on it?  Only had 16 left.  after losing my money on meme coins haha but that's my fault for listening to.  friends.  So invested my last 16 into VET.

However, I have only just begun with Binance and Coinbase. The former is already infuriating me whilst the latter has a great user-friendly interface and even a kid could use it. My query for you all though is.... On Binance I had initially transferred 50 UK pounds to the app and then transferred this sum to the Binance Wallet. But in doing this, it now feels as if my crypto is on an island and I have no means to transfer it out. It seems kind of insane that there isn't a simplistic way to transfer sums from the binance wallet to the funding or spot wallets OR simply to exchange from the binance wallet to Coinbase for example. Could anyone who is more savvy and in the know please lay it out for me and basically explain to me in depth how the hell can I transfer the crypto from Binance back into the funding or source AND then to Coinbase. (where I now have most of my crypto) by the way the crypto itself is XRP if that makes any difference. its so damn complicated. THANKS.",
