This is huge for us, and I gotta tell you why our communitys making this moment unstoppable. Stick with me - this is more than a coin its a family. Our community is massive - over 13,500 strong on Telegram alone, and growing like crazy on Discord, X, Instagram, TikTok, you name it. Its not just numbers; its the vibe. Weve got small investors, medium bag holders, and big whales all in the same boat, hyping each other up. Ive seen whales drop their own cash to push this billboard and marketing campaigns, while newbies share memes and ideas to keep the energy high. On Discord, its a riot people brainstorming, helping with wallet setups, even celebrating each others wins like throwing SOL for a members newborn. Its wild how tight we are. Instagrams blowing up too. Weve got marketing rolling, and huge pages - some with over 1 million followers - are posting videos about IMG. I saw one the other day breaking down our 5 tax that pays SOL to holders every few minutes, and the comments were lit with people jumping in. Solanas fast, cheap blockchain makes it all seamless, so those rewards hit your wallet like clockwork. It feels like passive income you can count on, and were all obsessed. This billboard isnt just a flex - its proof were here to stay. Were not some pump-and-dump were a home for everyone. Ive been in crypto a minute, and Ive never seen a community this united. From shilling on X to planning photoshoots at the billboard, were all in, big or small. I dont see this dying anytime soon - how could it when were driving it together? Im betting IMG will go crazy, and with Solanas tech, maybe even bigger with future DeFi tie-ins. joining us in NYC to see it go live? IMG feels like family, and Im proud to be part of it.",

They borrow money from the broker, at a 2x, 10x, 50x whatever. They predict the market will go up or down. If they predict itll go down. They short it. This means they take leverage ( a loan from the broker) at a price target, then if it hits the correct price predicted, they pay the loan back but keep the (x) profit. Same thing with longs, predict price will rise to a price target. Same thing, leverage loan at certain price, if target price hits, they pay back and get (x) profit.

No clear plan means no boom, just a dip. waiting to happen.  Crypto booms when it comes to the Rescue. To dodge tariffs., companies might start paying partly in crypto. Imagine buying a car for 10K. dollars: pay 2K in cash and 8K in crypto. Tariffs would hit just the 2Ksounds. like a win for us if things turn around! This is when I expect a serious boom. So, while everyones hyping the next big boom, Im expecting a deeper dip soon.. Whos with me on keeping it cool (and maybe laughing at the chaos)?

They talk about overall markets in general that feed into cryptos. For tokens, look at tokens that have a lot of TPS, 25000 TPS is a great amount. There are a lot of tokens that can do 75k-150k TPS. These tokens have scalability. Projects love to build on these because low fees and no congestion. Next, look at what projects are on that chain. Web 3 storage projects, lending and staking projects, DePin, great defi (DEXs), infrastructure addition projects. You can always chat gpt or grok detailed questions also about said chain. I like to find tokens that tokenize rwa, scalability and speed, low fees. Sui, Chex, hbar, solana, algo, ondo, sei are some of my favorites. Id advise dont buy meme coins unless youre down to lose some change and call crypto a scam. Good luck.",

However, the markets are still in trouble from a technical perspective as they are below 200ma. For anyone familiar with CANSLIM, Mike Webster is calling Friday a \"follow through day in spirit\" because although the indexes staged an advance that met the up requirement, the volume was poor and being under the key moving averages is not ideal. So what the fuck am I getting at? If you're a short term trader, be cautious. If you've been heavily short consider the potential short term shift to the upside. If you're going long, start small and build if the market is rewarding your plays. Stay on top of risk management. You don't have to always be in the market. If you're a long term holder, keep stacking and remember to focus on your timeframe.. day to day moves don't matter. You're building a stack for the future and your DCA is smoothing out the volatility over time.."

        "Body": "Ladies and degenerates, gather 'round for todays episode of What in the financial f just happened? So Trump, aka the orange volatility generator, decided to go full meme-lord during a rally and casually suggested that the U.S. should maybe default on its debt as a negotiation tactic. Yes. This man just tried to use Americas credit rating like a used Pokmon card. Naturally, the market heard default and immediately performed a 720-degree backflip off a cliff. Stocks dumped harder than my altbag after I said this project has real utility. The Dow? RIP. The SP? Sippin from the same red cup as Terra Luna. Nasdaq? It saw the light and screamed. Cryptos response? Bitcoin: Shot up because fiat bad, then remembered macro is still a thing. ETH: Followed like a loyal sidekick, tripped on gas fees, faceplanted. Solana: Froze for 7 minutes out of pure anxiety. DOGE: Barked, peed a little, rallied 8. Elon liked a tweet. Typical. My Ledger wallet: Started sweating. Meanwhile, over on Crypto Twitter: Half the influencers are screaming INFLATION HEDGE! The other half are posting screenshots of -84 drawdowns with the caption: Just DCA bro. Powell probably passed out. Yellens definitely stress-eating coins. Gold pumped. Even silver got a text saying you up? The only winners today are the ones holding volatility and the guy who panic sold everything last week because Mercury was in Gatorade. And dont even get me started on the stablecoins. USDT depegged for 14 seconds, USDC had a panic attack, and someone tried to pay rent in Dogwifhat. Landlord said no but asked how to buy it. In Conclusion: Trump opened his mouth. The market said F this, crypto moonwalked then tripped, and I aged 10 years watching my portfolio do cartwheels. Were either on the verge of a new bull run or a fiscal Armageddon no in-between. TL;DR: Trump said defaulting on debt might be cool, TradFi collapsed, crypto got excited then confused, and Im currently staring at 6 monitors like Pepe on 9 Red Bulls with a coffee mug that says To Rug Moun.

So in 3 weeks business owners will get a notice to pay 125 of their original order to clear the shipment through customs. At that point it is pretty damn clear that business owners are facing increased cost that must be passed on to the consumers. I expect to see calls for impeachment over it. And it is all for naught. The US makes up 3 of Chinas GDP. They could easily live without us. The notion they need us has been proven wrong since the last time Trump pulled the tariffs card. China simply found new trading partners. The GDP only measures hard goods. Services like payments for facebook ads and payments to American consultants. If it were measured by the GDP there would not be much trade deficit.",

        "Body": "Most people still look at Layer 1s like its 2021: speed, fees, hype, token price. But that phase is done. This next wave is about infrastructure development. L1s that can actually run complex systems across chains without breaking. We're entering an era where scalability isn't enough. Interoperability, composability, and full-stack control will define which chains survive. I've been looking at newer chains that aren't just launching empty narratives but are building tools from the ground up, supporting multiple VMs, handling cross-chain logic natively, and making sure developers aren't duct-taping modules together. Most of the well-known chains don't even come close to that level of integration. They rely on partnerships, plugins, or third-party devs to stitch things together, and that's fine for now. But when the next real adoption wave hits, the brittle stuff will break. One chain I've been exploring lately is Supra. It's not just another fast L1. It's designed as a fully integrated L1, with Dev Tools and features like MultiVM, Native Oracles, Native VRF, Automation, and Cross-chain Communication, which helps to accelerate web3 development by streamlining processes and providing essential infrastructure, ultimately reducing time to launch dApps on there. It's still early, but very promising. What actually matters now: Full integration from consensus to app layer, Native cross-chain support, Support for multiple virtual machines, Automation, Dev tools that reduce time-to-launch. It's not just about TPS anymore. It's about how well the chain can serve real devs over time. And supra feels like the kind of architecture that could quietly support the next generation of super dApps, without breaking a sweat.",

It's wild how much macro stuff is affecting the crypto scene right now. Some thoughts Ive been chewing on: Mining could get wrecked in the U.S. Most mining gear comes from China (Bitmain, Canaan, etc). If tariffs go through, its gonna get way more expensive to mine here. Could push more operations overseas or crush smaller miners altogether. BTC is acting more like a tech stock than digital gold. Every time Wall Street catches a cold, Bitcoin sneezes. Wheres that hedge against the system energy? Haven vibes incoming? On the flip side, if this trade war keeps escalating and fiat currencies start feeling the heat, could we see people flock to BTC as a digital haven again? Stablecoin squeeze? With rising tensions, is there a world where the U.S. or China starts cracking down harder on USD-backed stablecoins?

The kicker is, after January 1st, the market crashed and I made a couple. of bad decisionsso I basically lost almost everything. My portfolio is near zero. now.

        "Body": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency and emerging tech, it's crucial to identify high-potential projects before they explode. Two standout contenders that currently fly under the radar but are poised for massive growth are RENDER and CELL. These arent just any altcoins  theyre sleeping giants, waiting for the right macro and market conditions to awaken. And when they do, the gains could be extraordinary.  Lets start with RENDER. Often dubbed the Nvidia of crypto, RENDER is building decentralized GPU rendering power for the next generation of digital creators. In a world increasingly dominated by AI, 3D modeling, ARVR, and virtual worlds, the demand for rendering power is surging. But centralized GPU solutions are expensive, limited in scope, and prone to bottlenecks. This is where RENDER comes in  tapping into underutilized GPU power from around the globe and making it accessible in a decentralized way. Its a bold, visionary play that mirrors what Nvidia has done in traditional markets, but with the added upside of blockchain scalability and accessibility. As the metaverse, gaming, and AI sectors continue to expand, RENDER is uniquely positioned to ride the wave.  Now enter CELL  a lesser-known but highly ambitious quantum computing-related crypto. If youve watched the explosive moves of IONQ in the stock market, youll understand the potential upside here. CELL is betting on the intersection of blockchain and quantum tech, and while still early-stage, the team behind it and the underlying technology are worth serious attention. As quantum computing inches closer to real-world applications, security protocols, data transmission, and computational processes will need to evolve. CELL is one of the few projects aiming to tackle that future  before it arrives. Think of it as investing in cybersecurity before the internet became mainstream.  And heres the kicker: the market isnt paying attention  yet. Prices are down, sentiment is low, and many traders are distracted. But thats often when the best opportunities lie. The current dip in altcoins shouldnt be viewed as a failure, but rather a delay. Alt season isnt canceled  its just taking its time. As the broader macro environment shifts, especially with quantitative easing (QE) potentially returning to the narrative, risk-on assets like crypto could see a renewed surge. When liquidity floods back into the system, speculative assets tend to lead, and thats exactly the space RENDER and CELL occupy.  This is your chance to position ahead of the curve. Dont mistake quiet for weakness. Dont confuse discount prices with failure. These coins are fundamentally sound, aligned with emerging trends, and backed by powerful narratives that could easily capture market attention when momentum returns. In a market driven as much by story as by substance, both RENDER and CELL are bringing both  and thats rare.  The time to do your research is now. The time to accumulate is when the herd is asleep. And when the tide finally turns, those holding strong positions in these giants may find themselves sitting on generational opportunities.",

Its one of those things you dont notice until it fails and when it does, the effects ripple through the entire market. In contrast, platforms backed by robust market makers and deep liquidity pools can handle these moves without losing market stability. Liquidity isnt a background metric its the markets safety net.

Hypothesis: Given the current conditions, there's a strong possibility that a significant portion of the liquidity exiting the Chinese stock market could flow into cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional markets, crypto assets are not constrained by national borders, making them an attractive destination for capital seeking refuge from geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty.

The way exchanges are making it a competition by burning some amount of their native tokens almost every quarter of the year makes me wonder if it could assure some positive movements on price trends.

Historically, the silver to gold ratio was 100:1. It was like that for nearly 5,000 years. However, after it started getting traded as an ETF with futures, it started being manipulated down. Bear Sterns held a MASSIVE short position that squeezed the price of silver lower for nearly 20 years. When the bank failed in 08, JP Morgan took over the short position. They still have it to this day. The price of silver would skyrocket if the institutional shorts were to ever unwind. That's why the bankers didn't allow it to happen. Less silver has been pulled out of the earth each year for the past 15ish years as well. There is real scarcity because it is used for so many things.

In September of 2021, I had a three. coworkers (who were all brothers) who couldnt seem to stop talking about crypto. currency. One of those cryptos being gaugecash, or gaugefield. They all showed. me their crypto wallets, each of them having between 260k-380k worth of crypto. coins. They had dozens and dozens of different coins, with tens of thousands of. dollars invested in each. From bigrecognizeable ones like BTC and ETH and. Chainlink to smaller ones like HBAR and that shiba-inu one. They had convinced. me that within two or three years, this stable coin called GAUF would come out. and skyrocket in value. They each had about 20k-30k worth of GAUF each. One of. them had almost 400k GAUF coins. So due to their knowledge, prior investments,. and confidence, I believed them. I dont believe they were malicious, just. mistaken.  I ended up investing about 4,200 into GAUF. I wont give out the exact. amount I have but I have between 30k-60k GAUF coins. At the time, there were. updates coming out, on the gaugecash website and on reddit, and then the. gaugecash wallet came out. Manuel Blanco went on stage at some conference to. talk about his project. I was all in. Now its now April of 2025 and am now. convinced I just lost 4.2k years ago. No updates, no changes to the website, no. word from Blanco, no post on their Reddit, nothing. Im disappointed and annoyed,. but not looking for retribution or revenge, and am obviously expecting to be. grilled here. All I would like to know is when I should have known I was. scammed..",

Being a degen can be a hell of a task at beginning cos hassles like manually configuring wallets, dealing with separate private keys, then the briges and having tokens in all relevant ones before you swap... I forgot to mention the part you DYOR while relying majorly on materials (available) to you and then your own inexperienced judgement as a beginner.... then pray as hard as hell that you don't get rug pulled! I say this cos i know how much work most of us put in before we made a 1 gain... either ways, i just saw Bitget On-chain some days ago which promises to reduce the hassles so i updated the app and explored it... Firstly, the obvious feature for me was that it allows on-chain trading of assets directly through a spot account without any additional wallet or private key configurations... Secondly, the AI-driven screening was able to find opportunities without needing to spend nearly as much time research. If i were to DYOR to find all the info it had on the screen, I probably wont get the time to go through all the coins it had on DEX screen.... Lastly, the entry exams for being a degen is a lot easier with tools like these... Although i would never leave my generation future at the mercy of AI accuracy and trust, but it is a welcome development to filter and find the needle in the hay stack... anyone else tried this?.",

I work full-time, and my schedule is packedI barely have time to trade manually. Even when I do manage to squeeze in some time, I find myself falling into the emotional trap: overthinking, deviating from my strategy, and letting fear or greed take over. Honestly, discipline is something I struggle with. So, Ive been thinking about creating a trading bot using Python and Binance API to automate my trades. I know coding (at least enough Python to get started), but before jumping into this, I wanted to hear from others whove walked this path. Heres what Id love to know: 1. Has anyone here created a trading bot? If so, how did it go? Successes? Failures? 2. What strategies did you use? Did you stick to technical indicators, or did you incorporate machine learningAI? 3. How much time and effort did it take? Was it worth it in the end? 4. Any pitfalls or mistakes I should avoid? For example, over-optimization, poor risk management, etc. 5. Do you still use your bot actively? Or did you abandon it after some time? Im particularly interested in hearing both success stories and cautionary tales. I dont want to just copy-paste someone elses codeI really want to understand the process and build something tailored to my goals. But I also dont want to waste months on something that might not work out. If youve used a bot successfully, what advice would you give to someone just starting out? And if youve failed, what lessons did you learn that could help me avoid the same mistakes? Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts and experiences. Im excited to hear what you all have to say!",

Every month there's always something new to spend on, and I end up blowing most of my salary. So, I've decided to try something different: instead of trying (and failing) to save the usual way, I want to start investing at least ZAR1,000 per month in something a bit more exciting. I don't really want to go for tax-free savings. My current plan is to invest ZAR800 in Ethereum and ZAR200 in XRP every month and just hold them long-term. I know crypto is super volatile and risky, but honestly, I want to take the chance and enjoy the thrill. I'm okay with losing ZARR12,000 in a year if things go wrong. Someone also suggested I look into gold instead - it's safer and I'm considering that too. So, it's either crypto or gold, ZAR1,000 per month. What do the wise people of Reddit think? Is this a dumb idea? Does it make sense given my situation? Appreciate any advice!",
