        "Creation-Time": "2025-03-23 09:24:11",
        "Body": "Alright, lets rewind a bit and see how this shitshow got started. So, MANTRA. (OM) popped up on the radar in late 2023, right when the crypto space was already drowning in uncertainty. Outta nowhere, whispers started flying about a possible takeover. And guess what? Some big-name founder (whos probably trusted way too much) got hit with an offer to buy 30 of the projects tokens and tech for a cool 10 million. LMAO, what a bargain, right? Dude passed on the deal, but vultures LOVE distressed assets, and MANTRA being listed on Binance made it look extra juicy. Fast forward to December 2023 - boom, deal done. The buyers? Sharooq Ventures and Laser Digital (aka a Nomura Bank side hustle). What followed was the ol pump-and-dump playbook: grab a ton of tokens, jack up trading volume, and convince bag-holders theyre in on the next big thing. By early 2024, MANTRA was suddenly the hot topic in Web3, seeing miraculous price increases even when the market was tanking. Analysts were side-eyeing hard, noticing how a few big wallets were straight-up controlling the tokens price. Shocker. Come late 2024, some investors started asking, Uh, wheres my unlocked tokens? but lol, good luck with that. The MANTRA team just kept pushing back token unlocks like it was some kinda never-ending pre-launch waitlist. And those investors? Too scared to raise hell cuz the team held most of the damn supply. MANTRA Hits 8 But Whats Actually There? By February 2025, OM hit 8, making early investors laugh their way to the bank. But lets be real: no actual tech, no partnerships, and barely any blockchain activity. The market cap jumped from 5B to 7.16B in 24 hours, totally organic, Im sure. And heres where it gets even sketchier: 30 of all MANTRA tokens are chilling in just 10 wallets, each stacked with 150M to 1.2B. Meanwhile, real cryptos like ETH? 99 of its supply is spread out across normie wallets holding less than a grand. But nah, totally not manipulated, guys. So yeah, whos actually behind this circus? And why the hell is so much money being funneled in so aggressively? Meet The Masterminds. MANTRA (formerly MANTRA DAO) claims to be all about staking, DeFi, and Web3 finance. But if you peek behind the curtain, its really just a bunch of dudesJohn Patrick Mullin, Rodrigo Quan Miranda, and Will Corkinpulling the strings. In March 2024, they flexed about an 11M funding round led by Shorooq Partners, with backing from a laundry list of investors. But uh, did any of them actually check if MANTRA has a real product? Oh, and fun fact: The founders are also getting sued by RioDeFi shareholders, who say MANTRA DAO was basically stolen from them. Court-ordered financial disclosures are on the way, but so far, MANTRAs financial statements are conveniently missing, and the whitepaper link on their site? DEAD. Promises vs. Reality Back in the day, Mullin hyped up MANTRA like it was the second coming of Ethereum, talking about prototypes, millions in assets staked, and massive TVL. Fast forward four years? LMAO, nothing. No launchpads, no working products, nada. According to insiders, the founders even tried pawning off a huge chunk of the project for 510M but couldnt justify why anyone should pay that much. So what did they do instead? Market manipulation, baby. Classic. User Complaints: This Aint It, Chief For a so-called top 20 crypto, MANTRA has some of the deadest community engagement out there. Theyve got 500K followers on X (Twitter), but their posts barely crack 1020 comments. And Reddit? Ghost town. Meanwhile, random meme coins with smaller market caps have communities that are actually alive. Then theres the whole staking scam. One poor sucker tried unstaking 1K worth of OM and ended up paying 2,700 in fees. Yeah, you read that righthe lost more than he was trying to withdraw. The guy even warned others: They locked liquidity for their OGs and hit us with insane fees. Remember this when you decide to stake with them. But sure, lets pretend this token isnt just an exit liquidity farm. The Real Risks OTC Investors: Your tokens are locked, and you aint getting out anytime soon. Good luck. Retail Investors: The big wallets own most of the supply, so expect price manipulation and eventual rugging. Binance: Maybe do an actual audit before listing the next Ponzi, yeah? Final Thoughts: Whos Getting Wrecked First? MANTRA is just another project thats all smoke and mirrorsbuilt on token control and aggressive market manipulation rather than actual innovation. If youre still thinking about throwing money into this mess, just know that the big players will cash out first, and retail investors? Theyre the ones wholl be left crying in the end.

Tedious Ownership Transfers: Transferring a vehicle title can involve multiple third parties, extensive paperwork, and frustrating delays. Limited Global Access: Buying or selling vehicles across borders is complicated and expensive, making it nearly impossible for the average person. How Blockchain is Flipping the Script Accurate Vehicle Histories: With blockchain, every repair, accident, and title transfer is recorded in a tamper-proof, decentralized ledger, giving buyers and sellers full transparency. Cheaper, Fairer Financing: Platforms like CarrDefi offer decentralized lending, reducing the need for traditional banks. This creates more affordable and accessible financing options for a wider range of people. Effortless Ownership Transfers: Smart contracts can automate the entire ownership transfer process, making it instantaneous and secureno middlemen, no delays.

        "Body": "The U.S. real estate market is projected to reach an incredible 136.62T by 2025, a massive growth that reflects both the continued demand for real estate and the increasing innovation within the industry. One of the most promising trends contributing to this expansion is the rise of tokenization, which is helping to reshape how real estate investments are made. Tokenization refers to the process of converting ownership of a property or a group of properties into digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens can be bought, sold, and traded just like traditional assets, but with the added benefits of decentralization, transparency, and improved liquidity. This opens up opportunities for fractional ownership, where investors can buy smaller shares of a property or a real estate fund, lowering the barriers to entry and allowing a broader range of individuals to invest in high-value real estate. Web3 projects like LAND, RIO, PRO, and PROPC are uniquely positioned to benefit from this tokenization trend. These projects are leveraging blockchain technology to create platforms for fractional real estate ownership, enabling investors to access a diversified portfolio of properties with lower capital requirements. Theyre also offering a more transparent and secure way for investors to participate in the real estate market without relying on intermediaries like banks or brokers. For instance, LAND is focused on tokenizing virtual and physical real estate, while PROPC aims to simplify the process of owning shares in real-world properties through blockchain. Meanwhile, RIO and PRO are exploring ways to make real estate transactions and investments more efficient using smart contracts, further enhancing the security and ease of participation for both institutional and retail investors. One of the biggest advantages of tokenization is the enhanced liquidity it brings to traditionally illiquid real estate assets. In the past, investors had to commit large amounts of capital and wait years to realize returns on their investments. With tokenized real estate, individuals can trade their tokens on secondary markets, providing more flexibility and the ability to exit an investment more easily.",

TokenInsight assigns ratings based on factors like technology, adoption, and performance.

Do they influence your decisions, or do you rely more on personal research, market sentiment, and price action?

By the next time I invested (again, same target address for funds after rugpull), they pulled liquidity at 20 gains (previously they always made 100 gains). So, i observed again, seeing them make 100 gains again, and again, and again. but every time I invested even 5 (from the wallet I initially made earnings with), they would stop at around 15 to 25 gains.

Last year ONeal was accused of hiding the risks of buying NFTs and not warning about the losses investors could have (and actually had) when the platform went down. By November 2022, the platform had shut down without any explanation or refunds for those who had purchased what turned out to be unregistered securities. As a result, investors filed a lawsuit against Shaquille ONeal. The good news is that Shaquille ONeal finally agreed to pay 11M to investors who bought its NFTs. So, if you were damaged you can check the details and file to get payment. here(https:11thestate.comcasesastrals-investors-settlement). Anyways, were you damaged by this situation?

He did the mistake to call this number and those guys explained to him that he had to transfer all the money from Binance exchange to a wallet via web3. (They even gave him their wallet seed phrase to connect to it and to send the cryptos). He did this because he thought it was everything legit.

Stupidly I used my own BnB and it was sent to a scam address which looks like its accumulated a lot of tokens. Of course since sending, the comms stopped and hes got my money. I know what everyone will say, but it happens time and time again, Im just here to put his name out there. He had a tutorial online which I have reported too.

        "Body": "CubeSatGPT enables anyone to communicate with satellites and their payloads launched by Vector Space Biosciences. 50 Waterbears (Tardigrades) will be launched into space on CubeSats (nanosatellites) to generate high-value datasets related to microgravity and space radiation (stressors) beamed back to Earth using Microsoft Orbital ground stations. Datasets will be analyzed using advanced AI modeling, AI agents, inference, generative AI layers and visualizations. This pipeline will lead to new discoveries in medicine, materials, molecular, chemical and life sciences resulting from space-based operations and the new space economy. Vector Space Biosciences founder and CEO, Kasian Franks, states: Imagine enabling a student to ask a CubeSat carrying Waterbears questions using a prompt like How are the Waterbears doing today? or Describe how cold it is in space for the Waterbears to more advanced prompts involving details related to measurements in microgravity and radiation associated with payloads. This innovative CubeSatGPT module will be optional for all CubeSat launches including those for biotechnology, pharmaceutical, materials science and AI semiconductor payloads. Recently, stakeholders and shareholders of public and private companies, including Microstrategy (MSTR), have seen extraordinary benefits from holding part of their capital reserves in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and other alternative assets. Vector Space Biosciences is a private company structured to benefit stakeholders and shareholders which include our users, customers, partners and collaborators. Today, and similar to other proven and successful models, this is based on our own operations and holdings in cryptocurrencies. Our weighted holdings include Bitcoin (BTC), Vector Space Biosciences (SBIO), Vectorspace AI X (VAIX) including other spinoffs and subsidiaries through our VSB Ventures unit with each having a specific industry focus, corporate structure, equity arm, crypto arm, product line and revenue. A limited number of free subscriptions to the CubeSatGPT service will be available to K-12 students, teachers, educational institutions and EdTech companies as a utility enabling safe and secure access for students to communicate with CubeSats and get updates and education on tardigrades, CubeSats, space conditions, etc. This is a powerfully innovative way for children to learn about space and space biosciences. Each subscription comes with 1 SBIO AI model cryptocurrency token enabling access to CubeSatGPT. SBIO tokens can also be used by customers, partners and collaborators to access specialized services related to design, development and launching industry specific payload support in areas such as medicine, materials, molecular, chemical and life sciences resulting from space-based operations.

        "Body": "I put together a table ranking some top AI-driven crypto projects by their revenue and market caps. Its intriguing to see how OriginTrail (TRAC) stands out with a strong revenue-to-market cap ratio compared to other projects:. ProjectRevenue (Last 12 Months)Market CapRevenueMarket Cap :-:-:-:-. NEAR8M7.08B0.11 OriginTrail (TRAC)5.6M0.407B1.38 ICP2.82M4.34B0.06. RNDR1.54M3.93B0.04 GRT1.28M1.98B0.06 AKT1.05M0.98B0.11 LPT0.31M0.39B0.08 Key Observations: 1. TRACs Undervaluation: TRACs revenue-to-market cap ratio of 1.38 is still far ahead of its peers. Despite a slightly higher market cap (407M), it remains undervalued relative to its revenue compared to other projects. 2. Real-World Usage: TRAC powers OriginTrails Decentralized Knowledge Graph, which is already being adopted in supply chain, healthcare, and enterprise ecosystems. This makes it a utility-first project rather than one driven by speculation. 3. Growth Potential: With TRAC sitting at 407M in market cap, it has substantial upside. Scaling to market caps like RNDR or ICP (in the billions) would represent significant gains for holders, especially given its revenue metrics. Questions for Discussion:  Does TRACs revenue efficiency indicate its potential for larger adoption and market cap growth?  Should market valuations better reflect actual revenue performance?  Whats your take on TRAC compared to projects like RNDR or ICP in terms of innovation and utility? Looking forward to your insights and a lively discussion!",

My question is say I get up to 100,000 or 200,000 profit eventually and want to pay off my 10,000 credit card debt and some dental bills say 20,000. Say I take the 40,000 out I need to pay my bills eventually and then take another 50,000 out to put in the checking account, and then keep 110,000 in to HODL. How much would I end up owing in capital gains? I am worried about not having enough to pay the IRS once I pay my bills off. Or say I have only 20,000 and pay part of my bills off. Say I pay 7,000 of my 10,000 I owe to get my bills down and then pay 7,000 of my dental bills. 6,000 into the checking account. How much will I have to pay come tax time for the long term capital gains?",

        "Creation-Time": "2024-11-22 08:28:07",
        "Body": "I've got XRP on GateHub that has been on there since around 2018. I tried logging in for the first time since then to send to my ledger nano s plus and I've had issues. I was able to login, but it asked me right away to re-encrypt my account, which provided me with a new 32 character recovery code that I also wrote down. I have the old recovery code and now the 'new one.' I contacted support and they are saying that there was some issue with the 're-encryption process' due to the error 'errorsecretdecrypt'  (automod doesnt like URLs so I replaced them)  I went to(support gatehub net)and used the form on the page to submit a support ticket explaining the issue. they responded with this suggestion:  'Dear Sir or Madam,      We have a possible solution to your issue.. We kindly ask you to access your account via thewallet2page, which will access the older version. After accessing your account copy-paste the following link to your URL bargatrhub url security rekeyfix,enter your current password andold password, or current password and old recovery key (received during the signup process)in the fields.  After completion of the mentioned 'Rekeyfix' process, we kindly ask you to try re-encrypting your wallet once again (the step where you previously encountered the error). After a successful re-encryption log out of the account and access the updated version of our platform'  The wallet2 url and the 'rekeyfix' url just points back to gatehuband does nothing. I responded that it did not work, then they responded with:  'Dear Sir or Madam,      Due to the error message you received, which resulted in you being unable to access your account, we will refund the funds in your GateHub wallet(s).      In order to proceed with recovering the funds in your GateHub account registered to email redacted, we kindly ask you to register a new GateHub account using a different email address than you used to register your current account.      We will refundit with the same amount of XRP that you are currently holding in your wallet.  Please respond once your profile information is filled in and documents uploaded, so we can review your verification request ahead of the queue.  In addition, we would kindly ask you for additional information.      Due to the error you are experiencing you cannot use the wallet, therefore, we kindly ask you to provide the old recovery keyyou received during the signup processor the old passwordyou used prior to re-encrypting your account. Our development team is still working on identifying the cause of the issue that you have experienced and it would help us tremendously if you could share with us the original credentials from your old account.  The recovery key is a 32-character key,generated during the GateHub signup process.It is generated only once. We suggest that you look through your computer files for a txt document titled ''gatehubrecoverykey'' you may have downloaded on 2017, the day you registered your account.  Please note that we are asking for obsolete data. The old recovery key received during the signup process is no longer valid since you received a new one during re-encryption, also the old password cannot be used to sign in to your GateHub account.  Kind regards,'  Any concerns about this? I emailed security at gatehub net2 days ago but I have not received a response. Support is saying they will refund me the XRP in my account, however they need my old recovery key? This all seems strange and I'm very skeptical. My concern is that when I logged in, it prompted me to create a new recovery code which could be fake, and my first recovery code is still valid. Then when I send my 'old' recovery code, they will gain access to my assets. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. Thanks.",
