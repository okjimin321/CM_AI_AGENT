        "Body": "Welcome to the rBitcoin Newcomers FAQ  You've probably been hearing a lot about. Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions. should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions. feel free to ask them in the comments.    It all started with the release of. Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper(https:bitcoin.orgbitcoin.pdf) however that will. probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following. articlesbooksvideos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works. and a little about its long term potential:   Article: The Bullish Case for. Bitcoin(https:medium.comvijayboyapatithe-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1). Book: The Bitcoin Standard(https:www.amazon.comBitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-.

MicroStrategy's Bitcoin. for Corporations(https:www.microstrategy.comenresourceseventsworld-2021bitcoin-. summit?CID7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate. legal and financial Bitcoin integration.  You can also see the number of times. Bitcoin was declared dead by the media(https:99bitcoins.comobituary-stats). (LOL!)   Key properties of Bitcoin   Limited Supply - There will only ever be a. maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created(https:www.reddit.comrBitcoincomments10h04. a6thisishowweknowtheresonly21millionbitcoin) and they are issued in a. predictable fashion per the inflation. schedule(https:bashco.github.ioBitcoinMonetaryInflation).  Once they are all. issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The halving. countdown(http:bitcoinblockhalf.com) tells you approximately how much time until. the next block reward halving.  Open source - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.. You can read and contribute to the source code(https:github.combitcoinbitcoin). yourself.  Accountable - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are. seen by everyone(https:blockstream.info).  Decentralized - Bitcoin is globally. distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as. such can't be shut down similar to how. Bittorrent(https:en.wikipedia.orgwikiBitTorrent) works.  You can even run a node. on a Raspberry Pi(https:getumbrel.com).    Censorship resistant - No one can. prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor,. alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see Operation. Chokepoint(https:en.wikipedia.orgwikiOperationChokePoint).  Push system - There. are no chargebacks(https:gendal.me20131021lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull). in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin. resides has the authority to move them.  Borderless - No country can stop it. from going inout, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the. ledger is globally distributed(https:bitnodes.ionodeslive-map).  Trustless -. Bitcoin solved the Byzantine's Generals. Problem(https:en.wikipedia.orgwikiByzantinefaulttolerance) which means nobody. needs to trust anybody for it to work.  Pseudonymous - No need to expose. personal information(https:buybitcoinworldwide.comanonymity) when purchasing. with cash or transacting.   Secure - Blocks and transactions are. cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and cant be brute. forced(http:i.imgur.comfYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management. such as hardware wallets.  Programmable - Individual units of bitcoin can be. programmed to transfer(https:en.bitcoin.itwikiScript) based on certain criteria. being met  Divisible - Each bitcoin can be divided down to 8. decimals(https:en.bitcoin.itwikiSatoshi(unit)), which means you don't have to. worry about buying an entire bitcoin.   Nearly instant - From a few seconds on. the Lightning Network to a few minutes(https:www.blockchain.comchartsmedian-. confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions. are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by. anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations.   Peer-to-peer - No. intermediaries taking a cut, no need for trusted third. parties(https:nakamotoinstitute.orgtrusted-third-parties).  Designed Money -. Bitcoin was created to fit all the fundamental properties of. money(https:imgur.coma5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.  Portable - Bitcoin are. digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported. by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by. memorizing it for wallet recovery(https:en.bitcoin.itwikiBrainwallet) (while. cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting. the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.. Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use. and additional security).  Low fee scaling - Most wallets calculate on chain. fees automatically but you can view fee estimates(https:river.comlearnhow-. bitcoin-fees-work) and mempool activity(https:jochen-hoenicke.dequeue0,2w) if. you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to. network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations. are happening via the Lightning Network(https:lightning.network), an open source. second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The. Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin. with fees so low that they are negligible.  Scalable - While the protocol is. still being optimized for increased transaction. capacity(https:en.bitcoin.itwikiScalability), blockchains do not scale very. well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built. on top of Bitcoin.   Where can I buy bitcoin?. Bitcoin.org(https:bitcoin.orgenbuy) and. BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com(https:www.buybitcoinworldwide.com) are helpful sites for. beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars. worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit. card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are. listed below.   Strike(https:strike.me)  Cash App(https:cash.app). Swan(https:www.swanbitcoin.com)  River Financial(https:river.com)  Bull. Bitcoin(https:www.bullbitcoin.com)   Bitcoin Well(https:bitcoinwell.com). Relai(https:relai.app)  LibertyX(https:libertyx.com). CoinCorner(https:www.coincorner.com)  Bisq(https:bisq.network) (decentralized. P2P)  HodlHodl(https:hodlhodl.com?filters5Bcurrencycode5DUSD) (P2P)  List of. peer-to-peer exchanges(https:github.comcointasticalP2P-Trading-Exchanges). Debifi(https:debifi.com) (non-custodial lending)  You can also purchase in cash. with local ATMs(http:coinatmradar.com). If you would like your paycheck. automatically converted to bitcoin try Bitwage(https:www.bitwage.com).    Note:. Bitcoin are valued at whatever market price(https:aggr.trade1m1h) people are. willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional. markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.. Securing your bitcoin  With Bitcoin you can \"Be your own bank\" and personally. secure your bitcoin OR you can use third party companies aka \"Bitcoin banks\". which will hold your bitcoin for you.   If you prefer to \"Be your own bank\" and. have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party,. then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want. easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security. practices, then a hardware wallet such as a. BitBox02(https:bitbox.swissbitbox02),  Trezor(https:www.trezor.io),. ColdCard(https:coldcardwallet.com), or Blockstream. Jade(https:blockstream.comjade) is recommended. You can even build your own open. source hardware wallets called a SeedSigner(https:seedsigner.com) or. Krux(https:selfcustody.github.iokrux).   If you cannot afford a hardware wallet. there are many software wallet(https:bitcoin.orgenchoose-your-wallet) options to. choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like. BlueWallet(https:bluewallet.io) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.. Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.. Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.   If you prefer to work with third party. \"Bitcoin banks\" to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try Unchained. Capital(https:unchained-capital.com) but be aware that any third party you use. exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, \"Not your. keys, not your coins\".   Note: For increased security, use Two Factor. Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!   2FA requires a. second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account. making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and. Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make. sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.  Avoid using your cell number for. 2FA.  Hackers have been using a technique called \"SIM swapping\" to impersonate. users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.  Google Auth  Authy  OTP Auth.",

All thanks to taking a chance on Bitcoin. I still remember my coworker talking about crypto back in 2017 and me laughing it off as internet funny money. After weeks of him showing me charts and explaining the technology, I reluctantly threw in 500 I could barely afford just to shut him up. Best decision of my life. That initial investment turned into my obsession. I started researching everything I could about blockchain, decentralization, and investment strategies. I set up automatic weekly buys with whatever I could spare (20-50). Those small consistent purchases added up more than I ever imagined. When the 2021 bull run hit, my portfolio exploded. I was smart enough to take some profits (paid off 23k in student loans) but kept most invested. Even through the crash and bear market, my average buy price kept me well in the green. But the biggest change wasn't just financial - Bitcoin completely shifted my mindset. I went from someone who couldn't save a penny to someone thinking about long-term wealth building. I started learning about traditional investing, opened a Roth IRA, and even got serious about my career to increase my income. For anyone on the fence about crypto - I'm not saying throw your life savings in. But the journey of learning and small consistent investing changed everything for me. Anyone else have life-changing experiences with Bitcoin?",

It is absolutely true that stocks and shares investments made with a minimum of brain and without selling in times of crisis will allow not only to match inflation, but to prosper. Those who say otherwise and are constantly crying about 'the fiat currency that makes you poor' really understand zippo of investments, or have always been bad at  it.  However, what your guy misses is that what he is talking about is still exactly that: investments. Investments require at least the ability to stay cool in times of crisis, and this is already where most people fail. The most diversified investments like MSCI will always require at least this one ability, and again: most people just don't have it.  I have read around that more than 90 of the life yield of the average investor is determined by less than 1 of trading days: this is the crash days where everybody runs to sell like mad lemmings.  Bitcoin is very volatile for now, but the proper way of looking at it is to look at what it will become in the next decade or two: an alternative to gold that will be not more volatile than gold, which never disturbs anyone buying gold for long-term storage of wealth.  To me, this is the argument for Bitcoin: it is the modern Florin. You save in it, you put it aside, you don't look at it, it increases in value. There is no investment risk because it's not really an investment, it's pure storage of value like an old Florin or Ducat.  I don't buy the state control or anonymity advantages myself. Most normal people will buy their bitcoins in ETFs, and money laundering regulations will make total anonymity a dream. Even cold storage can be tracked.   In order to avoid all this, one needs so much work and precautions that such a person must be either a criminal, or someone at war against his own government; most people just aren't made that way, particularly Germans who are scarily obedient to the Obrigkeit (I know, I have lived in Germany many years).",

Have a job to where I can easily pay these bills monthly and save 20 percent of paycheck a week. Which is DCA daily into Bitcoin. Im guess Im trying to justify in my brain how to DCA more into Bitcoin by taking the amount of money I owe a month on bills plus the 20 percent I already DCA daily and when a bill comes due it comes out of my bank account and then I sell those Sats to replace what was taken out of my bank account. In theory and the long run I would have more SATS than if I just did 20 percent DCA. Can anyone please let me know if this is viable? I know there will be a Bear market where I will be losing money in the short term but at the same time I will be lowering my dollar cost average doing it this way.",

BTC at the time was worth 83,000. A week goes by but now BTC is now worth 79,000, do you still sell some SATS to cover the due bills? You’d be selling at a slight loss.  You could say, over the long run you’d could eventually come out on top. But I think the  gain might be very small still. Id even say on a 1,000 extra a month, you might only make an extra 1,000 after 5 years with this method.  Risk vs reward isnt really there.  Just do DoorDash twice a week, could put an extra 200 in easy if you’re in a good area for it."

For instance; salt was used so much as money originally, that it is the root for the word \"salary\" which comes from salarium, meaning payment in salt. Banco means bench or table. Medieval moneylenders sat at benches. If a banker failed, their bench was broken banca rotta bankrupt.. Credit is Latin and means \"to believe or trust\" as in you believe someone will pay you back. Fiat means \"let it be done\" or essentially I declare. Meaning, I declare this has value. Lets make a sentence and translate it: \"Fiat money is created using credit\" roughly translates into: \"I declare this newly made money has value and you believe that it will be paid back eventually\" Cheers and have a great weekend :).",

Basically, it's an web app where you can addimport your buysell transactions. (ps. I will never implement the sell function haha) of BTC and we can track. current price, PL of each purchase etc. Working on internal imported data, you. don't need to connect anything (walletexchangeetc).

Installation will be simple, just run npm app (its written mainly in JS. with node) or run docker container. Some screenshots in the attachments :).

I thought maybe it cant be fixed afterall. I used to cry. I got depressed to the point of almost killing myself. But I was too stubborn and afraid. I thought meaning came from struggle. I thought life is supposed to be like this. But then I found bitcoin. Tbh, I just came for the quick buck. But then I studied it for about half a year. All day long, I did nothing else. And my life changed. I just could not believe it. The more I studied, the more questions occurred. But the more I learned, the clearer the picture got. I feel reborn. It was almost a spiritual journey. Just felt like sharing this. Since no one of my family or friends can relate, I thought some of you can. I wish you all the best and a wonderful life.",

I read everything I could on it before making my first purchase. I bought a ledger a long time ago as it was one of the most secure item to hold my cryptos. All my crypto-savings were on it. A couple days ago I saw that my PayPal account has been hacked and someone stole 1000 by making a purchase with my credit card. I called my bank, cancelled it and got refunded. This morning I went on the ledger app to check my btc and saw 3 instead of the 30k (0.3BTC) I had. And then everything clicked. Someone did not hacked my PayPal but my iCloud. And somehow found my encrypted file with some seeds on it. It is my entire fault and I am the only responsible for what happened to me. I guess this message is to warn everyone. Sometimes your crypto is secured, but something else isnt and they hack from there. To the person who stole my money, have fun with it, I personally hope that you will choke on it and die slowly.  Edit: guys I know I was dumb. Dont rub it in. To answer the most common comment, yes I know that you dont write your seed phrase online. But when I bought my ledger in 2018 I didnt know.

        "Body": "The dollar is dumping because the US 10 year yield is spiking higher. The 10 year yield rising is due to someone forcibly dumping US treasuries (when bonds lose demand yields rise) so this loss of confidence in the bond market translates into a loss of confidence in the currency itself. They are dumping treasuries because something in the financial market broke (maybe a big bank or china dumping US treasuries). This was all triggered by the tariff mess whiplashing the markets. So the tariff mess caused something to break which is causing bonds to be sold and yields to rise, which is then causing a loss of confidence in the value of the dollar leading the DXY index to drop. Usually in normal circumstances rising bond yields would entice bond buying and in turn make the dollar stronger, but currently rising yields are not a sign of strength they are a sign of bonds being forcibly sold which is pointing to a loss of confidence in the bond market and therefore a loss of confidence in the dollar. Historically the US bond market along with the dollar have been viewed as the reserve safe haven currency, meaning in times of market turmoil bond yields and the currency should rise together. Yields rising while the currency falls is something only seen in weak emerging market currencies. This all points to a shift in the global financial system. The market is no longer treating the dollar like a safe haven, they are now treating it like a failing emerging market currency. If people are no longer running towards the dollar then they need to find other safe havens like gold and bitcoin. TLDR; as the dollar index falls bitcoin will rise.",

I'm pretty confident that my seed phrases are safely stored, so I don't worry about them being stolen. The problem is that they are not readily accessible, even to me. Remembering a sequence of 12 to 24 words in a precise but nonsensical order is basically impossible, unless you're the Real Rain Man. from YouTube or the guy who can tell the shopkeeper the UPC code for everything he just bought or your man who can tell you the value of  to the nth decimal place, well, you're going to forget your seed phrase. I don't need a seed phrase often, but I have needed one before and it's very inconvenient to access it. Are there any simple ways that balance safety and convenience?

She'll have the reassurance that huge asset managers like Blackrock or Fidelity are backing it up and it'll be very easy to get that exposure. She can then ramp up her exposure to ETF based Bitcoin as she feels more comfortable with the risk. I think the 1 issue is 'knowing what you own', don't stress or get shaken out by volatility, and consider this as a truly long term hold. In the meantime, she can do research and learn self custody and all the benefits, risks, and responsibilities there. Then depending on her comfort level, either keep holding those ETFS with a larger position gradually, andor start taking self-custody starting small and ramping up as she feels more comfortable.",

This is because each private key can derive its corresponding xpub. Putting the xpubs on metal is overkill. Just print out a sheet of paper with each backup that includes all the information to reconstruct the wallet. The paper should include the xpub of each key, the derivation path of each key, the address type of the wallet (e.g. P2WSH) and the starting address index (probably 0). The last two pieces of information you could guess and check, but since you're already printing out copies you might as well make it as easy as possible for your future self who is restoring from a backup and include every relevant detail about the wallet. It's also completely acceptable storing your wallet metadata and xpubs digitally. You're risking privacy, not necessarily security.

The project has been around for a few years and was started to develop the area by supplying affordable electricity to the community. The grid is isolated and is not connected to the Zambian national grid. Zambia has an overall shortage of electricity which results in load shedding for 8 to 12 hours daily in most of the country. The excess of electricity from the Zengamina grid cannot be exported though and thus a unique situation existed. Mining Bitcoin has been the solution to monetize the excess electricity to further develop the grid and subsidize consumers. I visited the site a few years ago with a team of engineers that were scouting the area for sites to build hydro electric plants. It's a fascinating project and I'm delighted to hear they adopted bitcoin mining as part of it.",

This notion is based on the idea that both BTC and gold are capped, but this is not exactly true. Bitcoin is capped at 21M coin, and there is a finite amount of gold on Earth, yes, that's correct. However, NASA and other tech firms are exploring mining options for asteroids containing gold. Most people aren't cognitively capable of understanding and comprehending the size of celestial bodies, but golden asteroids and infinite gold are basically the same thing. If mining is conducted on golden asteroids, the amount of gold will be so huge, that we can assume we will never run out of gold or reach a point where demand outpaces the supply. If space mining happens, gold price will go down significantly. It will eventually happen, it's just a matter of time until we have fully re-usable rockets and launching costs are reduced to the point, where constant launches, missions and returning rockets are a profitable business. Bitcoin solves this, because there are no asteroids containing Bitcoins. Gold will always be finite... until it isn't. Technically, Bitcoin's 21M supply can be increased, but this requires the approval of nodes and miners, meaning everyone will have to agree to lose profits, meaning it's never gonna happen.

I've been in this space for over a decade and early on I learned I should stay away from leverage... or rather I thought I did. For some reason (long story) I decided to go long on bitcoin with leverage. I wanted to be stress-free so I kept a significant balance (5 figures) and used little margin. I entered at around 82k last week and my liquidation was at around 74k, which I thought was very safe. All was good until Sunday. I can't explain the stress I suffered the following days. At some point the price touched 74.4k, very close to liquidation. The whole time I was literally this guy(<https://www.memeatlas.com/images/wojakswojak-stage-6-doomer.png>) looking at the chart deciding whether to exit and lose 60-70-80 or wait. I couldn't work, eat, spend time with family or friends, or do anything other than think about why I did this stupid trade. It was money that I could afford to lose, but the psychological damage of losing it would have been hard. In any case I decided to wait. Fortunately yesterday I was able to exit safely with minimal loss (I could have waited more and exit with gains but I wanted to be out ASAP). I think my life expectancy just dropped a little after all this, but hopefully this time I learned the lesson. No more leverage trading for me. I truly can't believe people do this on a daily basis!.",

Unfortunately, the screenshot is in German. What do you think of this graphic? I find it really interesting. Here are the individual points translated into English: No inflation possible. Infinitely divisible. Liquid. Portable. Transmittable. Sendable. No cost of carry. No third-party access possible. No controlling authority. Accessible everywhere. Durable. Verifiable.
